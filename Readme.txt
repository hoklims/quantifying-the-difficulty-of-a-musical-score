This code is used to calculate the difficulty of a synchronised partition made up of two partitions, one on the right and one on the left. It does this by considering the difficulty of each partition separately and the difficulty of the synchronised partition as a whole. The difficulty of each partition is calculated by considering the differences between consecutive elements in the partition, and the difficulty of the synchronised partition is calculated by considering the differences between corresponding elements in the right and left partitions. The overall difficulty of the synchronised partition is then calculated by adding up the difficulties of the right, left, and synchronised partitions.
